    <h3> What is Onigiri? </h3>
    <p> Onigiri (お握り or 御握り), also known as omusubi (お結び), nigirimeshi (握り飯), 
        or rice ball, is a Japanese food made from white rice formed into triangular or 
        cylindrical shapes and often wrapped in nori.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>

    <ul>
        <li> 6 mini Seaweed Sheets (Nori) </li>
        <li> 3/4 Shredded Cooked Salmon</li>
        <li> 1 TBSP Mayonnaise</li>
        <li> 6 Cups of cooked sticky rice</li>
        <li> Triangle shaped cookie cutter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps for making this delicious snack:  </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by slicing your nori sheets in half lengthwise. Mix the mayonnaise into your salmon until well coated. 
                Set the salmon mix and nori aside.</li>
            <li>Put the cookie cutter on a flat surface. Place an 8″x8″ sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie cutter and push <br>
                some of it it down inside so that the inside of the cookie cutter is completely lined with plastic wrap. Scoop  <br>
                approximately 2 tbsp of rice into the bottom of the cutter and press it flat with a plastic spoon or small rubber  <br>
                spatula (the rice won’t stick to the tools as much as it sticks to fingers!). When flattening the rice, push it around  <br>
                so that it reaches right up to the corners of the cutter (add more rice if needed to make sure the bottom is completely coated).  <br>
                Place 1 tsp salmon filling into the middle of the rice, spreading it around just a little, so there will be a little salmon in <br>
                each bite of rice when you’re finished. </li>
            <li>Place a couple more tablespoons of rice on top and flatten out as before. Add a little extra rice if you need more to cover up <br>
                the salmon. Wrap the plastic tightly over the exposed end of the onigiri and pop it out of the cookie cutter. Firmly wrap any <br>
                loose ends around the outside of the onigiri. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining rice and salmon until you run out of ingredients (for me, this made 12 rice balls). </li>
        </ol>

    <h4  style="color: red">NOTE: If you’re using freshly cooked rice, wait until the rice is cool enough to handle. If using cold leftover rice, <br> 
        reheat it in a microwave at 30 second intervals until slightly warm—not hot. </h4>
