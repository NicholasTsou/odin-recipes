        flavors are soy sauce and miso, with typical toppings including sliced pork, nori, menma (bamboo shoots), <br>
        and scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes. Nearly every region in Japan has its <br>
        own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido.</p>
