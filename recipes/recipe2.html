    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 2/5 cup of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>40g Sugar</li>
        <li>180 ml warm milk OR 150 ml or warm water</li>
        <li>1 TBS vegetable oil</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>200g red bean paste filling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps for making this delicious snack:  </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a pot and put it on low, low heat</li>
        <li>Add milk and use a thermometer to heat until 35C</li>
        <li>Add to a large bowl with the flour, sugar, yeast, vegetagble oil and salt</li>
        <li>Mix with a spoon or mixer with paddles for kneading/after switch to your hands to knead the dough</li>
        <li>Get everything worked in nice and good before setting it in a room temperature area for an hour for the <br>
        dough to rise. What we did was we set the oven to 250 F and put a dish towel over the bowl. We set this on top <br>
        of the oven to get the heat. </li>
        <li>When there's about 20 minutes left, add water to the steamer and set it to steam.</li>
        <li>After an hour, add like a tablespoon or 2 more of the flour and knead some more</li>
        <li>When it seems like it's not too rough, break up into about 6 little dough balls</li>
        <li>Use your fingers to flatten these out but make the edges thinner than the center. <br>
        I started from the center and pushed/pinched outward until it seemed wide enough, that <br>
        it could fold into a ball again</li>
        <li>Spoon the red bean paste into the center and close it up nice and tight.</li>
        <li>Flip these over and shape into a dome as much as you can</li>
        <li>Line the steamer bowl with parchment paper</li>
        <li>So here, we were supposed to place them, have the steamer off and let them prove for another 20 minutes.<br> 
        I didnâ€™t read the instructions all the way through. So we just went straight to steaming for 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>When they are done steaming, turn off the steamer and leave them in there for about 5 more minutes</li>
    </ol>
